these
	toHaveProperties
	toHaveOwnProperties
	toExactlyHaveProperties
	toStartWithEither

all accept seperate arguments, while
	toStartWith
	toEndWith

accept single value or array


needs the basic test (I added it)
	toHaveLength

these use a different check for seemingly same item?
	toThrowInstanceOf
	toBeInstanceOf
maybe im confused though (and what about Object.create() or funky prototype/constructor styles?)

some matchers could allow RegExp's
