these
	toHaveProperties
	toHaveOwnProperties
	toExactlyHaveProperties
	toStartWithEither
all accept seperate arguments, while
	toStartWith
	toEndWith
accept single value or array


needs the basic test (only tested a null case)
	toHaveLength

maybe  these use a different check for seemingly same item?
	toThrowInstanceOf
	toBeInstanceOf
or im confused
and what about Object.create() or funky prototype/constructor styles?

some matchers ideally should allow RegExp's

missing?
    toEndWithEither (per toStartWithEither)
