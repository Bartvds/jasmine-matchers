some matchers accept multple seperate arguments
	toHaveProperties
	toHaveOwnProperties
	toExactlyHaveProperties
	toStartWithEither
while
	toStartWith
	toEndWith
accept either a single value or a single array and iterate it. maybe those toHave's should allow an array as single argument as well so we can share the values without .apply()

this needs the basic test (only tested a null case)
	toHaveLength

this one is missing according to pattern
    toEndWithEither (vs toStartWithEither)

maybe these use a different check for seemingly same item?
	toThrowInstanceOf
	toBeInstanceOf
and what about Object.create() or funky prototype/constructor styles?
(maybe i'm just confused about meaning of the test)

some matchers ideally chould allow RegExp as string match
